# Fun-number-splitting
A PHP page is used to split numbers like 6=5+2+0+1+3-1-4! (The JS version will be supported in the future)

Splitting numbers is popular on the internet now, so it took me almost 3 hours to complete this code. Since I didn't study PHP professionally, the code may not be perfect.Welcome to submit a PR!
